Notice that this suggestion requires you start the homework before the due date... When you keep the material in your subconscious you will solve problems and have breakthroughs at the strangest times. I've solved some of the most difficult problems I have worked on when waking up in the middle of the night, but I rarely solve something if I have been working on it the last 6 hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second is to get help if you are stuck or convinced that your code is correct. 'Rubber duck debugging' is very real and explaining your code to someone else often breaks the functional fixedness that is hiding something in plain sight. It is expected that you will require help to get through this class and notebook. A small part of class time is dedicated to this but email and office hours will also be key tools you are expected to utilize. If the office hour times do not work for your schedule make sure to schedule some!"
